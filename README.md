**Project Title:**

Joker



**Project Overview:**

An IoT project using the Wokwi ESP32 simulator to create an interactive joke machine.
The system displays jokes, allows user ratings, reacts with motion and sound, updates jokes by shaking, categorizes them via API, and adjusts display brightness automatically — all simulated without real hardware.



**Main Features:**

1. Rate jokes using the keypad

2. Show last update time

3. Robot arm and laughter reaction

4. Shake-to-update jokes

5. Categorize jokes using API

6. Control display brightness



**Expected Outcome:**

A fully functional virtual IoT system that demonstrates event-driven control, interactive feedback, and API communication within the Wokwi environment.
